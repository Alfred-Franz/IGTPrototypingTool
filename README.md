# TrackingDataAnalysisTool

A tool to perform data analysis on tools exposed over an OpenIGTLink interface.

# Building

This tool requires Java 8, due to some dependencies not operating in newer
versions of Java.  To build, you can import this project as a Gradle project
into your IDE, or you can run in a terminal:
```bash
./gradle.bat build # builds the project
./gradle.bat run # runs the main program
```
